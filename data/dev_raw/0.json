        "but not if you live in new england or surrounding states .",
        "\" we will not ship snow to any states in the northeast ! \" says waring 's website , shipsnowyo.com . \" we 're in the business of expunging snow ! \"",
        "his website and social media accounts claim to have filled more than 133 orders for snow -- more than 30 on tuesday alone , his busiest day yet .",
        "with more than 45 total inches , boston has set a record this winter for the snowiest month in its history . most residents see the huge piles of snow choking their yards and sidewalks as a nuisance , but waring saw an opportunity .",
        "according to boston.com , it all started a few weeks ago , when waring and his wife were shoveling deep snow from their yard in manchester - by - the - sea , a coastal suburb north of boston . he joked about shipping the stuff to friends and family in warmer states , and an idea was born .",
        "his business slogan : \" our nightmare is your dream ! \"",
        "at first , shipsnowyo sold snow packed into empty 16.9 - ounce water bottles for $ 19.99 , but the snow usually melted before it reached its destination .",
        "so this week , waring began shipping larger amounts in the styrofoam cubes , which he promises will arrive anywhere in the u.s. in less than 20 hours .",
        "he also has begun selling a 10 - pound box of snow for $ 119 .",
        "many of his customers appear to be companies in warm - weather states who are buying the snow as a gag , he said .",
        "whether waring can sustain his gimmicky venture into the spring remains to be seen . but he has no shortage of product .",
        "\" at this rate , it 's going to be july until the snow melts , \" he told boston.com . \" but i 've thought about taking this idea and running with it for other seasonal items . maybe i 'll ship some fall foliage . \""
