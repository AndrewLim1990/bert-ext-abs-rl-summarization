        "( cnn ) my vote for father of the year goes to curt schilling . the former major league baseball pitcher recently fired off a series of fastballs and mowed down a group of twitter trolls who made the mistake of tweeting vulgar and sexually - explicit comments about schilling 's teenage daughter .",
        "the drama started , innocently enough , on february 25 , when schilling played the role of a proud father . he sent a tweet congratulating his daughter , gabby , on being accepted to salve regina university , where she 'll play softball .",
        "it read : \" congrats to gabby schilling who will pitch for the salve regina seahawks next year !! \u2014 curt schilling ( @gehrig38 ) \"",
        "almost immediately , responses came in from young men , complete strangers who apparently followed schilling on twitter . the tweets quickly went from immature , to creepy , to repugnant . threats of rape were common .",
        "the tweets were deleted , and the accounts were closed after this story went viral . but not before schilling captured some of the images and posted them on his blog .",
        "what was said about 17 - year - old gabby schilling was n't just obnoxious . it was vile and obscene . what was said was n't just mean and ugly . it was threatening and scary . as a parent , it 's the kind of thing that makes you rethink your opposition to public caning as a logical punishment for such transgressions .",
        "these misogynistic cowards may have thought they could hide in the darkness of anonymity , the sort that many have come to expect from social media sites , where you feel free to be a despicable human being because , you think , no one will ever find out who you really are and hold you accountable for your words .",
        "if so , they thought wrong . they could n't hide . they were found out , and they got the throttling they so richly deserved .",
        "thanks to dad . according to schilling , who made it his mission to track down these cretins and make sure those they associate with know who they really are , two people have already paid a price due to their tweets .",
        "one was a student disc jockey at a community college in new jersey , who was suspended , and the other was a part - time ticket seller for the new york yankees , who was fired . concerned that this is an example of exactly the kind of cyberbullying that leads some teenagers to commit suicide , schilling is also thinking about taking legal action against some of the other people involved .",
        "bravo for him . i 'm sure that , all across america , dads with daughters -- after reading some of the horrible things that were said about this young girl -- are marveling at schilling 's self - control . i have two daughters of my own , and he 's a better man than me . if ever there was a case where profanity - spewing malcontents deserved to have their mouths washed out with soap , this is it .",
        "so what additional insights can we draw , and what larger lessons can we learn , from this unexpected but predictable collision of old - fashioned parenthood and newfangled media ? there are a few .",
        "the first is about accountability , the very thing that the young men who posted these hurtful messages were trying to avoid . but schilling would n't let them . at their best , social media sites like twitter , facebook , instagram and others allow the sharing the information and the building of a sense of community .",
        "at their worst , they become digital sandboxes and locker rooms where people think have a license to misbehave without having to worry about consequences . we need to applaud efforts like this that promote greater online accountability .",
        "there 's also something to be said about protective parents , and how essential they are to a working society . we should still be concerned about those overprotective parents who hover like helicopters from little league to job interviews . we should n't bubblewrap our kids , and keep them from playing outdoors , and then sit around wondering why they 're soft , timid , and risk - averse .",
        "but protective parents -- the kind who shield their kids from real danger -- never go out of style . a parent 's top job is to protect his children . schilling did his job .",
        "finally , it 's worth reminding everyone that freedom of expression does not mean freedom from rules , standards , and expectations that should guide your behavior . there are things you do n't say . there are boundaries , ways that we expect you to behave so you do n't terrorize other people or bring shame upon yourself , your friends , and your family . if you do n't have social skills , you do n't belong on social media .",
        "the tweets make you wince . but in this story , you 'll still find plenty to smile about . this whole drama unfolded because schilling was proud of his daughter . now , given how he reacted , we all have reason to be proud of him ."
